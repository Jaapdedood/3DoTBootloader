  44:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** Many AVRs contain a Power Reduction Register (PRR) or Registers (PRRx) that 
  45:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** allow you to reduce power consumption by disabling or enabling various on-board 
  46:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** peripherals as needed. Some devices have the XTAL Divide Control Register
  47:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** (XDIV) which offer similar functionality as System Clock Prescale
  48:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** Register (CLKPR).
  49:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** 
  50:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** There are many macros in this header file that provide an easy interface
  51:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** to enable or disable on-board peripherals to reduce power. See the table below.
  52:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** 
  53:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** \note Not all AVR devices have a Power Reduction Register (for example
  54:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** the ATmega8). On those devices without a Power Reduction Register, the
  55:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** power reduction macros are not available..
  56:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** 
  57:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** \note Not all AVR devices contain the same peripherals (for example, the LCD
  58:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** interface), or they will be named differently (for example, USART and 
  59:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** USART0). Please consult your device's datasheet, or the header file, to 
  60:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** find out which macros are applicable to your device.
  61:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** 
  62:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** \note For device using the XTAL Divide Control Register (XDIV), when prescaler
  63:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** is used, Timer/Counter0 can only be used in asynchronous mode. Keep in mind
  64:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** that Timer/Counter0 source shall be less than th of peripheral clock.
  65:/usr/lib/avr/include/avr/power.h **** Therefore, when using a typical 32.768 kHz crystal, one shall not scale
